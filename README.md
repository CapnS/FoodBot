# Installation Instuctions
Looking to run this bot with another Token? Follow the installtion instructions below. Please note I would rather you **invite** my bot instead rather than running another instance of it.

```markdown
git clone https://github.com/CapnS/FoodBot.git <!--Cloning the repo-->

cd Foodbot

pip install --user --requirement requirements.txt
<!-- Remember: Only use this if you only have python 3 installed. -->

or

pip3 install --user --requirement requirements.txt
<!-- Remember: Use this if you have two versions of python and / or you have python 2 and python 3. -->

Thats it, you should be able to run the bot file with `python bot.py` **or** `python3 bot.py`. Make sure you put in your Discord token.
